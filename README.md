This is some plain text that forms a paragraph.
Add emphasis via **bold** and __bold__, or *italic* and _italic_.
Paragraphs must be separated by an empty line.
* Sometimes we want to include lists.
* Which can be indented.
1. Lists can also be numbered.
2. For ordered lists.
[It is possible to include hyperlinks](https://www.example.com)
Inline code uses single backticks: `foo()`, and code blocks use triple backticks:
```
bar()
```
Or can be indented by 4 spaces:
    foo()
And finally, adding images is easy: ![Alt text](https://www.example.com/image.jpg)
